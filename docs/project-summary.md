# Project Summary

TaskFlow is a task and project management app for small teams that want clarity without overhead. It keeps work organized in projects, shows the status of every task at a glance, and helps teams assign ownership quickly. The experience is built around simple, visible workflows so people can move work forward without extra meetings and without losing context.
