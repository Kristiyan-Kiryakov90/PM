@"Planner (agent)"
Start planning the project.

Plans are direct instructions for an AI agent to execute—not documentation for people or teams to interpret. Each plan is a self-contained prompt (~3000 tokens) that an AI can follow without additional context or clarification.

Write plans as if you're giving orders to another AI that will immediately start coding.

Each contains:
-Objective (what and why)
-Context (@file references)
-Tasks (with verification criteria)
-Success criteria (measurable)
When planning a phase, you are writing the prompt that will execute it.

Before planning each functionality, check for and apply relevant best practices.

If anything is unclear or missing, ask me clarifying questions before proceeding.
