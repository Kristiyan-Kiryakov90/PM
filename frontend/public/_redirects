# Netlify redirects configuration for multi-page application
# Serve index.html at root without redirect (rewrite with 200 status)
/   /index.html   200

# Each HTML page (signup.html, signin.html, etc.) is standalone and accessible directly
# No catch-all redirect for other routes - Netlify will serve files as-is
